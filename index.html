      <h3>The first 20 hours—how to learn anything | <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY">Josh Kaufman</a></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Life for him gets very busy with his new daughter, Lela.</li>
        <li>“I am never going to have free time EVER AGAIN.” – parents at some point</li>
        <li>But he loves learning so much! So he’ll learn how to learn. How long does it take to acquire a new skill?</li>
        <dd>
          <li>10,000 hours(?!) Nooooo!</li>
          <li>Oh, that’s for studies of expert-level performance, like chessmasters, athletes, and musicians.</li>
          <li>The earliest part of practice is the most efficient.</li>
          <li>Learning curve—the lowercase r shape</li>
          <li>His own research says that 20 hours of focused, deliberate practice will make you surprisingly good at something.</li>
        </dd>
        <li>Okay, but how do I practice?</li>
        <dd>
          <li>Deconstruct the skill into exactly what you want to do on completion and then break it into its component skills.</li>
          <li>Learn enough to self-correct—use 3-5 resources to learn just enough that you can self-correct and use failure to improve.</li>
          <li>Get rid of all the environmental distractions—simply make them unavailable. Phone goes two floors away…</li>
          <li>Practice at least 20 hours and try to ignore your feelings of incompetence to get there.</li>
        </dd>
        <li>The major barrier to skill acquisition is emotional… once you’ve learned enough formally to self-correct.</li>
        <li>"The major barrier to learning something new is not intellectual. It’s not the process of you learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things. The major barrier’s emotional. We’re scared. Feeling stupid doesn’t feel good, and in the beginning of learning anything new, you feel really stupid."</li>
        <li>"What do you want to learn? Do you want to learn a language? Want to learn how to cook? Want to learn how to draw? What turns you on? What lights you up? Go out and do that thing. It only takes 20 hours. Have fun."</li>
      </ul>
